    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hello, My name is William Tyler Hudson but I go by Tyler. This is my last term here at the University of Oregon and will be graduating with a degree in economics. After I get my degree I am moving back to my home in Fairbanks Alaska starting a job with Alyeska Pipeline Service Company. I enjoy Nature and often use my free time to spend time with nature wheather its camping, hunting, or just spending the day on a boat. </p>
